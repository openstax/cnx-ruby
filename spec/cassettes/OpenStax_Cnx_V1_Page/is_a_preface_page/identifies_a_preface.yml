        for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and
        allied health students.  The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most
        Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were
        informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course.  Instructors can
        customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.  \nThe
        artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful
        blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.   Color is
        used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration.  Significant
        use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations,
        and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept.  Finally,
        enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly
        in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended
        careers.</div>", "revised": "2019-02-07T22:07:05Z", "printStyle": null, "roles":

        based at Rice University, and it\u2019s our mission to improve student access
        to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in
        2012, and our library has since scaled to over 25 books for college and AP<sup>\u00ae</sup>
        courses used by hundreds of thousands of students. Our adaptive learning technology,
        designed to improve learning outcomes through personalized educational paths,
        is being piloted in college courses throughout the country. Through our partnerships
        with philanthropic foundations and our alliance with other educational resource
        organizations, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning
        and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</p></section><section

        and Scope</h4><p id=\"eip-369\">The units of our <em data-effect=\"italics\">Anatomy
        and Physiology</em> textbook adhere to the scope and sequence followed by
        most two-semester courses nationwide. The development choices for this textbook
        were made with the guidance of hundreds of faculty who are deeply involved
        in teaching this course. These choices led to innovations in art, terminology,
        career orientation, practical applications, and multimedia-based learning,
        all with a goal of increasing relevance to students. We strove to make the
        discipline meaningful and memorable to students, so that they can draw from
        it a working knowledge that will enrich their future studies.\n</p><section
        data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-217\"><h5 data-type=\"title\">Unit 1: Levels of
        Organization </h5><p id=\"eip-719\">Chapters 1\u20134 provide students with
        a basic understanding of human anatomy and physiology, including its language,
        the levels of organization, and the basics of chemistry and cell biology.  These
        chapters provide a foundation for the further study of the body.  They also
        focus particularly on how the body\u2019s regions, important chemicals, and
        cells maintain homeostasis.<span data-type=\"newline\"><br/></span>     \nChapter

        Movement </h5><p id=\"eip-760\">In Chapters 5\u201311, students explore the
        skin, the largest organ of the body, and examine the body\u2019s skeletal
        and muscular systems, following a traditional sequence of topics.  This unit
        is the first to walk students through specific systems of the body, and as
        it does so, it maintains a focus on homeostasis as well as those diseases
        and conditions that can disrupt it.<span data-type=\"newline\"><br/></span>  \nChapter

        Integration, and Control</h5><p id=\"eip-595\">Chapters 12\u201317 help students
        answer questions about nervous and endocrine system control and regulation.
        In a break with the traditional sequence of topics, the special senses are
        integrated into the chapter on the somatic nervous system. The chapter on
        the neurological examination offers students a unique approach to understanding
        nervous system function using five simple but powerful diagnostic tests. <span

        the principal means of transport for materials needed to support the human
        body, regulate its internal environment, and provide protection. <span data-type=\"newline\"><br/></span>\nChapter

        Exchange</h5><p id=\"eip-965\">In Chapters 22\u201326, students discover the
        interaction between body systems and the outside environment for the exchange
        of materials, the capture of energy, the release of waste, and the overall
        maintenance of the internal systems that regulate the exchange.  The explanations
        and illustrations are particularly focused on how structure relates to function.   <span

        the male and female reproductive systems, describe the process of human development
        and the different stages of pregnancy, and end with a review of the mechanisms
        of inheritance. <span data-type=\"newline\"><br/></span> \nChapter 27 The

        information on the various careers often pursued by allied health students,
        such as medical technician, medical examiner, and neurophysiologist. Students
        are introduced to the educational requirements for and day-to-day responsibilities
        in these careers.</li>\n<li><strong>Everyday Connections</strong> tie anatomical
        and physiological concepts to emerging issues and discuss these in terms of

        Effect of Second-Hand Tobacco Smoke.\u201d</li>\n<li><strong>Interactive Links</strong>
        direct students to online exercises, simulations, animations, and videos to
        add a fuller context to core content and help improve understanding of the
        material. Many features include links to the University of Michigan\u2019s
        interactive WebScopes, which allow students to zoom in on micrographs in the
        collection. These resources were vetted by reviewers and other subject matter
        experts to ensure that they are effective and accurate. We strongly urge students
        to explore these links, whether viewing a video or inputting data into a simulation,
        to gain the fullest experience and to learn how to search for information
        independently.  </li></ul></section><section data-depth=\"2\" id=\"eip-72\"><h4
        data-type=\"title\">Dynamic, Learner-Centered Art</h4><p id=\"eip-287\">\nOur
        unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most
        important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at
        focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions
        and instructional innovations.  \n</p>\n\n<p id=\"eip-id1167703115240\">Much
        of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest
        line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used
        to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify
        the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique
        is intended to draw students\u2019 attention to the critical learning point
        in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows,
        and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires
        it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).\n</p>\n\n<span

        id=\"fs-idm629835024\">By highlighting the most important portions of the

        without overwhelming them.</p>\n\n\n<section data-depth=\"3\" id=\"eip-817\"><h5
